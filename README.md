# BasicTwitterapp
Use of Twitter Api to demonstrate How to use it.

One can find this on twitter documentation also. It is easy to implement if anyone want to work further on this can raise a issue and then make a pull request as this is very basic design so the UI is also not very good so it is for learning purpose only.

# To run :

Download the zip file or fork the project in your system and open android studio


In the value -> string files replace the data with your twitter consumer key and your twitter app secret key and then build the app


You will get the consumer key and secret key from the twitter developer app website and then your app is ready to go
